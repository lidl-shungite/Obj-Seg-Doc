# Object Segmentation using YOLOv8 and U-Net

This repository contains the code and dataset for segmentation using YOLOv8 and U-Net.

Firstly, we will discuss how to install YOLOv8. Run the following code in your favourite command shell. In my case, I used Anaconda Prompt to install it in the Python virtual environment. 

```shell
pip install ultralytics
```
